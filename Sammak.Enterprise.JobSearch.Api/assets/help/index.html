<h2>
    DO NOT Create a documentation build until you are fairly certain you have all the classes created.
</h2>
<p>
    When you build the documentation project the post build will move all the documentation files to this project.
    Which means this help index goes away.
</p>
<p>
    After you do the first document build you will have to add all the files be copied to output dir
